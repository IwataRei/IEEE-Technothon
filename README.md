One common problem that occurs in college is not knowing what your roommate is doing at a given moment in their room. Our project plans to make a notification system that will display the status at any given moment with options such as busy, available, or sleeping with a 7 segment display on a breadboard with buttons/switches as options. This will also update on a website we plan on making.

Parts we plan on using include a ESP32, LED lights, buttons, and ir transmitter/receiver.
